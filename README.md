# Camper Leaderboard in React

Project is part of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) curriculum

User Stories: 
* I can see a table of the Free Code Camp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
* I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
* I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
